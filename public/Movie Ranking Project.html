<h1>Leeroy's Movies - The Best of the Best!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>This movie had all the elements of winning an Oscar Award [even though it did not]. As a Marvel Studios fan, I enjoyed this movie because of the storyline and the action scenes and the emotional rollercoaster that it made me go through. It will always be my best movie.</p>
<h3>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</h3>
<p>A cyborg, a kid, and a badass Linda Hamilton take on a liquid metal nightmare! Explosive action, iconic one-liners, and the ultimate motorcycle chase. Still one of the coolest sequels ever—Hasta la vista, boredom!</p>
<h3>Gran Turismo</h3>
<p>From gamer to racer, this adrenaline-fueled ride proves virtual skills can pay off! High-speed thrills, heart-pounding races, and a story that feels too wild to be true (but it is!). Buckle up—this one is a winner!</p>
